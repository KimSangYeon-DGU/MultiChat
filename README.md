This is a program for multi chatting and it is implemented by using Versatile Socket 

https://github.com/KimSangYeon-DGU/Versatile_Socket

## Why are you making this program?
I want to share my application with many developers, students, and anyone, and I know many students struggle to choice project's theme.

So, I think it would help them for doing projects.

## What it is used for?
This program is basic but has many potential for scalability.

So, anyone who needs this program for their personal or company projects can use it.
